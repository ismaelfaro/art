Ideas in the cloud,
Ideas in the world of ideas
I donâ€™t see anyone jumping high enough 
to take them,
Ideas exploding in the clouds
leaving digital fires in an infinite loop
that makes us cry 
from the impossibility of blinking

It turns out that we confuse clouds with smoke 
when we lie down to contemplate 
it all we scorch thorns and ribs,
We burn bone marrow 
we have no choice but to become digital
