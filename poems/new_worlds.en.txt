Vast are the heavens
and above they plant worlds
Octavio Paz

New worlds,
New worlds from which to escape,
New worlds because this one is getting old
New worlds because the flight forward seems 
like the only way to handle
an existence without the possibility of answers,
New worlds that we build 
so we can have answers that
the ones that built old worlds don’t have,

New worlds,
New worlds that want to be future 
but are only present,
New worlds that become old right 
when they are created,
New worlds that can’t be new 
without a new language,
New worlds built with old materials, 
inhabited by old people

New worlds,
New worlds when 
the one we thought was old is still new
New worlds that will get older faster and faster
New worlds that will never give us 
what we wanted, ones that don’t need 
flesh and bone, just spirit

New worlds of live organisms 
instead of containers of live organisms,
New worlds that will only be new if we fill them 
with new belongings and new individuals
New worlds that will only be new 
if we smother them before we create them
