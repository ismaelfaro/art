Ideas in the cloud,
Ideas in the world of ideas
I don’t see anyone jumping high enough 
to take them,
Ideas exploding in the clouds
leaving digital fires in an infinite loop
that makes us cry 
from the impossibility of blinking

It turns out that we confuse clouds with smoke 
when we lie down to contemplate 
it all we scorch thorns and ribs,
We burn bone marrow 
we have no choice but to become digital

To be at the right place at the right time

May you keep this sensation in a blockchain
Don’t forget it,
Sensation that we were going to change the world
everything happens for a reason
We will always be friends 
walking around on a sunny day
we didn’t even need to remember 
where we were coming from,
Digital immigrants traveling with lifeboats 
from different times,

One of a kind,

Not expendable because we encrypt ourselves 
in hugs made from DoCs and Bpros,
eternal second, in which kindness 
covers the planet like a naïve tsunami 
of transformed energy,
all sickness healed without war, or hunger, 
or all of the other weaknesses 
that make us so human that we can’t stand ourselves 
and we are obliged to swiftly eliminate ourselves 
for the good of the planet,
eternal second,
the revolution we sought,
the zillionth scam to the zillionth power,

A group of words physically pronounced 
cross the air and they form an image 
that lifts us up,

Changing the dance allows us 
to see excited bodies, 
the ones containing so many dreams 
that the streets are deprived of oxygen 
from the deep breaths of these living, 
inedible organisms,

One of a kind,

resting peacefully in their code fountain,
Synthetically searching for new truths, 
they head towards the nucleus,

Stripped of its clothing, the cell strolls naked 
through the streets of Greenpoint 
looking for a blockchain to call home,

The blasphemous poison that carries us 
towards programmed death,
an existence housed in the mines of Langfang 
or perhaps in a Dataist church in Chicago,

Crypto-predators and crypto-poets 
rejoice in the code’s truth with the POW workers, 
confidence in a system that nobody can destroy
if we stay united,
if we inhabit what makes us unique,
One of a kind,
Not expendable 
because we encrypt ourselves in hugs,
in tightly held hands

A gram of Ethereum falls on the floor 
of a restroom in an art gallery in New York,
Two friends discuss the DAOs 
in a backyard on Kent Avenue,
Elon Musk tweets about fossil fuels 
and my roommate loses thousands of dollars,

Mint me, turn me into something unique,
Token me again and 
give out my little bits to engineers,
Hyper put me in an infinite sequence 
until it overloads,

We are trying to discover 
the deformed mask that hides scammers 
of this non-religion 
whose gods are being invoked 
in real time and live streaming,

What if we are the scammers?
What if this is just an inflated balloon between us?

The fathers are Sathoshi Nakamoto
We continue
distributing helium amongst mortals

Minotaurs that don’t have to learn to way back,
Now they drive horse-drawn 
carriages without fear of getting burnt, 
creating the legend’s code,
constructing the primary material 
with which new realities are written,

Meanwhile,
the artists think that only creativity 
protects purity,
the main reason for creating the piece of art,
this idea spreads like a fine film 
over this level of impertinent reality
like Hephaestus’s net over 
the unfaithful Ares,

The rest will be mud and sand,
blood and guts,
broken glass put back together 
without shine or rhyme,

Let’s get out of this binary logic!
Let’s reach towards a new level of reason!
Let’s debate until we arrive 
at something that isn’t either of us, 
something that is found out of this world, 
but affects this world,

The terrifying hybrid because it’s unknown 
will be the next evolutionary step

Mint me, turn me into something unique,
Token me again 
and give out my little bits to engineers,
Hyper put me in an infinite sequence 
until it overloads

Vast are the heavens
and above they plant worlds
Octavio Paz



New worlds,
New worlds from which to escape,
New worlds because this one is getting old
New worlds because the flight forward seems 
like the only way to handle
an existence without the possibility of answers,
New worlds that we build 
so we can have answers that
the ones that built old worlds don’t have,

New worlds,
New worlds that want to be future 
but are only present,
New worlds that become old right 
when they are created,
New worlds that can’t be new 
without a new language,
New worlds built with old materials, 
inhabited by old people

New worlds,
New worlds when 
the one we thought was old is still new
New worlds that will get older faster and faster
New worlds that will never give us 
what we wanted, ones that don’t need 
flesh and bone, just spirit

New worlds of live organisms 
instead of containers of live organisms,
New worlds that will only be new if we fill them 
with new belongings and new individuals
New worlds that will only be new 
if we smother them before we create them


Art is a game 
And not everyone is invited to play,
Art is a game 
And if Picasso had been born in Botswana 
nobody would be buying postcards 
with his works in the gift shop of the MET,

Art is that which we agree is art,
If someone doesn’t agree, 
we call them a heretic and we throw them 
in the Hudson with a sculpture of Robert Indiana 
tied to their legs to see if they float,

It’s art if it doesn’t sink in the dirty waters,
It’s art if five zeros line up to get in your wallet,
It’s art if it smells like gold, 
tastes like gold and 
weighs the same as gold,

It’s art if you stop repeating how good it is 
and you stop to look at it, 
if you stop trying to understand,
explain it,

Picasso en Botswana passing out pulas 
and on the walls of the MOMA 
they hand pieces of his melted ego,
Without seas,
Without people,
Rivers of people doing what they DON’T feel, 
doing what they think they’re supposed to do, 
what someone told them they should do or 
what they read in the Time Out New York,
in the Brooklyn Rail,

The Setinkane drum sounds and 
someone plays the Phala
Picasso walks slowly 
through the streets of Gaborone 
while on the other side of the world, 
a painting that he didn’t paint 
sells for millions of dollars,
Nobody knows who Picasso is

I can’t believe you idiots are buying this
Banksy

Baring witness is participating,
two hundred grams of aluminum and glass
you hold in your hand while 
your eyes hypnotically contemplate 
the vertical scroll,
collection of chords 
that vibrate asynchronously 
in the absence of beauty,

your hands too,
your eyes too,
your neurons too, 
the ones that die in the repetitive synapsis 
of hypnotic enjoyment,

Shredding after selling,

Burning the original after selling the digital copy,
it is not a copy anymore,
it is not something analogic,

Shredding after selling,

Encrypting before anyone finds 
the tomb of the original profit and 
we are resurrected from this alienated sensation 
that we are more alive than ever,

Shredding after selling,

Giving a piece of dead skin that’s 
at the point of falling off from gravity’s reign 
or a piece of the right ventricle at its height,
so, we can prove
that the object’s weight and profundity don’t matter
only the sensation you get when you touch it,
only the far-off feeling of the primitive attribute 
that disappears if we stop using it.

Shredding after selling,

Physical scraps,
finite and infinite chains that prevail,
They don’t exist they aren’t anywhere
You can’t stop the digital wave,
this horizontal yelp that lifts you up 
to listen to incomprehensible words, 
a tsunami of zeros and ones, of blinking lights 
that blind and consume at the stake, 
the one that awaits those that believe 
in this insane transformation.

Sheredding  after selling.

A new shadow is forming in the cave,
The fire of the future replaces the fire of the past, 
while the burning present
longs for serpentine flames 
that can reach the heavens of knowledge 
finally free,

White smoke sustains 
the cement of civilization, 
as we know it,
Black smoke
when hate replaces understanding,

Shredding after selling,

Mint the ashes of what used to be,
but
What happens when there is nothing left 
because there is nothing combustible left to burn?
When the servant burns too 
like his children burn and the children of his children?

The new universe cannot be imagined from our reality
it went back in time to build itself.
