I can’t believe you idiots are buying this
Banksy

Baring witness is participating,
two hundred grams of aluminum and glass
you hold in your hand while 
your eyes hypnotically contemplate 
the vertical scroll,
collection of chords 
that vibrate asynchronously 
in the absence of beauty,

your hands too,
your eyes too,
your neurons too, 
the ones that die in the repetitive synapsis 
of hypnotic enjoyment,

Shredding after selling,

Burning the original after selling the digital copy,
it is not a copy anymore,
it is not something analogic,

Shredding after selling,

Encrypting before anyone finds 
the tomb of the original profit and 
we are resurrected from this alienated sensation 
that we are more alive than ever,

Shredding after selling,

Giving a piece of dead skin that’s 
at the point of falling off from gravity’s reign 
or a piece of the right ventricle at its height,
so, we can prove
that the object’s weight and profundity don’t matter
only the sensation you get when you touch it,
only the far-off feeling of the primitive attribute 
that disappears if we stop using it.

Shredding after selling,

Physical scraps,
finite and infinite chains that prevail,
They don’t exist they aren’t anywhere
You can’t stop the digital wave,
this horizontal yelp that lifts you up 
to listen to incomprehensible words, 
a tsunami of zeros and ones, of blinking lights 
that blind and consume at the stake, 
the one that awaits those that believe 
in this insane transformation.

Sheredding  after selling.

A new shadow is forming in the cave,
The fire of the future replaces the fire of the past, 
while the burning present
longs for serpentine flames 
that can reach the heavens of knowledge 
finally free,

White smoke sustains 
the cement of civilization, 
as we know it,
Black smoke
when hate replaces understanding,

Shredding after selling,

Mint the ashes of what used to be,
but
What happens when there is nothing left 
because there is nothing combustible left to burn?
When the servant burns too 
like his children burn and the children of his children?

The new universe cannot be imagined from our reality
it went back in time to build itself.
