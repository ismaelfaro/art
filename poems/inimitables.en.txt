To be at the right place at the right time

May you keep this sensation in a blockchain
Don’t forget it,
Sensation that we were going to change the world
everything happens for a reason
We will always be friends 
walking around on a sunny day
we didn’t even need to remember 
where we were coming from,
Digital immigrants traveling with lifeboats 
from different times,

One of a kind,

Not expendable because we encrypt ourselves 
in hugs made from DoCs and Bpros,
eternal second, in which kindness 
covers the planet like a naïve tsunami 
of transformed energy,
all sickness healed without war, or hunger, 
or all of the other weaknesses 
that make us so human that we can’t stand ourselves 
and we are obliged to swiftly eliminate ourselves 
for the good of the planet,
eternal second,
the revolution we sought,
the zillionth scam to the zillionth power,

A group of words physically pronounced 
cross the air and they form an image 
that lifts us up,

Changing the dance allows us 
to see excited bodies, 
the ones containing so many dreams 
that the streets are deprived of oxygen 
from the deep breaths of these living, 
inedible organisms,

One of a kind,

resting peacefully in their code fountain,
Synthetically searching for new truths, 
they head towards the nucleus,

Stripped of its clothing, the cell strolls naked 
through the streets of Greenpoint 
looking for a blockchain to call home,

The blasphemous poison that carries us 
towards programmed death,
an existence housed in the mines of Langfang 
or perhaps in a Dataist church in Chicago,

Crypto-predators and crypto-poets 
rejoice in the code’s truth with the POW workers, 
confidence in a system that nobody can destroy
if we stay united,
if we inhabit what makes us unique,
One of a kind,
Not expendable 
because we encrypt ourselves in hugs,
in tightly held hands
