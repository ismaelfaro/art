Art is a game 
and not everyone is invited to play, 
Art is a game 
and if Picasso had been born in Botswana 
nobody would be buying postcards 
of his works in the gift shop of the MET, 

Art is what we agree art is, 
and if someone doesn’t agree, 
we call them a heretic and we throw them 
in the Hudson with a sculpture of Robert Indiana 
tied to their legs to see if they float, 

It’s art if it doesn’t sink in the river, 
It’s art if five zeros line up in your wallet, 
It’s art if it smells like gold, 
if it tastes like gold, 
if it weighs the same as gold, 

It’ll be art if you stop repeating how good it is 
and you stop to look at it, 
if you stop trying to understand it, 
to explain it, 

Picasso in Botswana passing out Pulas 
and on the walls of the MOMA 
pieces of melted egos are hanging, 
Without oceans, 
Without people, 
Rivers of people doing what they DON’T feel, 
doing what they think they’re supposed to do, 
what someone told them to do or 
something that they read in the Time Out New York, 
or in the Brooklyn Rail, 

The Setinkane drum sounds and 
someone plays the Phala 
Picasso slowly walks 
through the streets of Gaborone 
while on the other side of the world, 
a painting that he didn’t paint 
sells for millions of dollars, 
Nobody knows who Picasso is
